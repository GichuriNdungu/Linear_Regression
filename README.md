**Optimization Using Gradient Descent: Linear Regression**

This project builds a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. Three different approaches to this problem are investigated; 
1. Using **Numpy** 
2. Utilizing **Scikit-learn**
3. By **constructing and optimizing the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent**
